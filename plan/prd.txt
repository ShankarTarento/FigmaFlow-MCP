Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Product Name

Figma MCP for GitHub Copilot (VS Code)

1. Product Overview
1.1 Product Vision

Enable developers and QA engineers—especially on Linux—to seamlessly convert Figma designs into Flutter UI code, widget tests, and QA test cases directly inside VS Code, while working alongside GitHub Copilot.

The product acts as an AI-powered bridge between design and development using:

Figma API (design source)

MCP (orchestration & intelligence)

VS Code extension (developer interface)

1.2 Problem to Solve

Developers today face:

Manual interpretation of Figma designs

Inconsistent UI implementation

Time-consuming test creation

No Linux-native design → code/test tooling

GitHub Copilot lacking design context

1.3 Target Outcome

Reduce:

UI implementation time

QA test creation effort

Design-to-dev misunderstandings

Increase:

Code consistency

Test coverage

Developer velocity

2. Target Users & Personas
Primary Personas
👨‍💻 Flutter Developer

Works in VS Code on Linux

Uses GitHub Copilot daily

Wants faster UI implementation from Figma

🧪 QA / Automation Engineer

Writes widget tests and manual test cases

Wants tests generated from UI designs

Needs structured, editable output

Secondary Personas

Tech leads

Product engineers

Design system maintainers

3. User Stories
Core User Stories

As a developer, I want to generate Flutter widgets from a Figma screen so that I don’t manually recreate UI layouts.

As a QA engineer, I want widget tests generated from designs so that UI changes are covered automatically.

As a developer, I want to run this inside VS Code so that I don’t leave my workflow.

As a Copilot user, I want to refine generated code using Copilot Chat.

As a Linux user, I want full functionality without a Figma desktop app.

4. Functional Requirements
4.1 Figma Design Input

Accept Figma file URL

Accept optional node ID

Validate access permissions

Fetch design data using Figma API

Acceptance Criteria

User can paste a Figma URL

System fetches design metadata successfully

Errors are shown clearly if access fails

4.2 MCP Orchestration Layer

MCP server runs independently (local/cloud)

Exposes tool-based APIs:

get_figma_design

generate_flutter_widget

generate_widget_tests

generate_qa_testcases

Handles AI model invocation

Produces structured output

Acceptance Criteria

Tools are callable via HTTP

Inputs/outputs follow defined schemas

Server is stateless for MVP

4.3 Code & Test Generation
Flutter Widget Generation

Generate valid Flutter widget code

Respect layout hierarchy

Use Material widgets by default

Widget Test Generation

Generate Flutter widget tests

Cover basic rendering and interactions

Use best practices (pumpWidget, finders)

QA Test Case Generation

Generate readable test cases

Output in text or JSON

Cover UI states and validations

Acceptance Criteria

Generated code compiles

Tests run successfully with minimal edits

Output is deterministic and readable

4.4 VS Code Extension

Provide commands:

“Generate Flutter Widget from Figma”

“Generate Widget Tests from Figma”

Prompt user for Figma URL / node ID

Insert generated code into workspace

Support Linux environments

Acceptance Criteria

Commands appear in VS Code Command Palette

Output is inserted into correct file

Errors are shown in VS Code UI

4.5 GitHub Copilot Compatibility

Generated output must be Copilot-friendly

Copilot can explain/refactor generated code

Commands can be triggered via Copilot suggestions

Acceptance Criteria

Copilot Chat can meaningfully interact with output

No conflict with Copilot extension behavior

5. Non-Functional Requirements

Linux-first compatibility

Secure token handling

Response time ≤ 10 seconds (MVP)

Clear error messages

Extensible architecture

No dependency on Figma desktop app

6. Out of Scope (Explicit)

Copilot for Figma integration

Editing Figma files

Real-time design sync

Mobile IDE support

Figma plugin development

7. User Flow (MVP)

User opens Flutter project in VS Code

User runs command:
“Generate Widget Tests from Figma”

User enters Figma URL

VS Code extension sends request to MCP

MCP:

Fetches design from Figma API

Processes layout

Calls AI model

Generated code/tests appear in editor

User refines using GitHub Copilot

8. Technical Constraints

Figma API is read-only

Copilot cannot call external tools directly

MCP must remain external

VS Code extension must be thin (no AI logic)

9. Success Metrics (KPIs)
MVP Metrics

Time saved per screen implementation

Number of generated tests used

Extension install count

Command execution success rate

Qualitative Metrics

Developer satisfaction

QA feedback

Copilot interaction usefulness

10. Risks & Mitigations
Risk	Mitigation
Inconsistent AI output	Structured prompts & schemas
Figma API limitations	Node-level fetching
User mistrust of AI code	Clear, editable output
Copilot overlap confusion	Clear positioning
11. Release Plan
MVP (Phase 1)

MCP server (local)

Figma API integration

One VS Code command

Flutter widget or test generation

Phase 2

Web UI

Saved projects

Output history

Better component reuse

Phase 3

CI integration

Design drift detection

SaaS offering

Team collaboration

12. Product Positioning

“Not a Copilot replacement — a Copilot amplifier for design-driven development.”

Key differentiators:

Linux-first

Design → Test automation

MCP-powered

Copilot-compatible

13. Open Questions

Should MVP focus on widgets or widget tests first?

Should output be file-based or snippet-based?

Local-only MCP vs cloud-hosted MCP?

14. Next Steps

Lock MVP scope

Finalize MCP tool schemas

Build MCP skeleton

Create VS Code extension PoC

Demo with real Figma file
